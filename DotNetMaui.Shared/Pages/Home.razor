<h1>About Me</h1>

<p class="lead">
    Hello, I'm a dedicated computational linguist with a passion for machine translation,
    breaking down language barriers, and helping rebuild the Tower of Babel, one brick
    at a time.

        <p>
            I'm currently a PhD student in computer science at Portland State University.
            A product of an immigrant father from Montenegro and a mother who taught ESL,
            I grew up in a multilingual household and traveled frequently to Europe. This
            early exposure to different languages and cultures sparked my lifelong
            fascination with language and the power of communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was also inspired to study technology after watching Star Wars as a child.
            My favorite character was C-3PO, a protocol droid <q>fluent in over six million
            forms of communication.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i><strong>My goal is to help people communicate better, no matter what
            language they speak.</strong></i>
            I believe that language is a bridge that connects us all, and I'm committed to
            building technology that makes communication easier and more accessible for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>And that's computational linguistics—the perfect fusion of computers and language.</p>
